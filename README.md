This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


all code is in  develop branch.

to get started please run the following
*****
run `yarn` to install dependancies

run `yarn start` to start the project, which should automatically open a browser window for you.


#### Currently working:
When you load the website, page loads with the products and an empty cart. If you click on "add to cart", it will add a product to the cart. 

There is no Redux in the project, if I there had been more time I would have liked to have added Redux for the add to cart feature (please see Future Development below) as well as functionality to remove an item from the cart.

#### Future Development
If there had been more time, I would have liked to have added Redux to the project as mentioned above.

As well as implementing the cart feature using Redux, i would have done the sorting with redux as well.

I would have also liked to have added the modal for showing the quick view for the products.


I look forward to hearing your feedback.
